#### Abstract
Is your relationship with maths... complicated?

Do you hate doing simple, repetitive, error prone calculations that you know your computer could trivially do?

Have you ever been disappointed by Wolfram Alpha's inability to calculate your problems, with working out?

Then book a session and Iâ€™ll show you how to use Python, SymPy, and Jupyter Notebooks to resolve your love problems, all with working out!

#### Description
If you hate doing simple, repetitive, error prone calculations that you know a computer could trivially do, then this is the talk for you!

You'll learn the basics of the SymPy library, and then be walked through how to solve a sample university level maths problem. Then, we'll put these two together and use SymPy to solve this math problem for us, in a way that also prints working out!

You'll also see how Jupyter can be used to calculate and submit parts of your assignment, and finally how you can help contribute to the computational maths community.
